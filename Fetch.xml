            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Here’s why learning, doing, and adapting will always matter!</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XvRq5fLcaDySwwFHcV-64Q.png" /></figure><p>In today’s fast-paced world, it can be tempting to feel overwhelmed by how quickly things are changing. But as we look to the future — whether in 2025 or 2035 — there’s one skill set that will always stay relevant: the ability to learn, do, and adapt.</p><h4>Embracing Change</h4><p>No matter where you are in your career or life journey, learning and adjusting is critical for staying ahead. As the world evolves, so do industries, markets, and the demands placed on us. We’ve all seen it: one job might be booming today and disappear tomorrow. So, how do we keep up?</p><p>The key is to embrace a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. Take technology, for example. A decade ago, skills like Java programming were in high demand. Today, data science and AI are the new hot topics. But who knows what the next big shift will be?</p><p>Rather than trying to predict the future, focus on being flexible. Learning new skills, exploring new hobbies, and staying curious about the world around you will always be valuable. As we continue to see these shifts, one thing remains constant: those who can adjust and grow will always find success.</p><h4>Learning Never Stops</h4><p>Contrary to what many people believe, education doesn’t end when you leave school or college. Whether you’re in your 20s or approaching your 60s, there’s always something new to learn. The world doesn’t stand still, and neither should we.</p><p>One of the biggest misconceptions is that your learning journey stops once you enter the workforce. Nothing could be further from the truth. Successful individuals are constantly expanding their knowledge base, whether through formal education, self-study, or real-life experiences.</p><p>It’s important to love the process of learning itself. Discovering something new every day should feel exciting, not burdensome. Whether you’re picking up a new skill, diving into a new subject, or just exploring something out of curiosity, remember that learning is a lifelong endeavor.</p><h4>The Importance of Doing</h4><p>Learning without action is incomplete. Once you’ve absorbed new knowledge, it’s time to put it into practice. Whether it’s coding, writing, or solving math problems, only by doing can you truly grasp a skill.</p><p>Think about learning a new language. You can study the vocabulary and grammar for hours, but until you start practicing with real conversations, you won’t get very far. Doing reinforces learning, turning abstract concepts into practical knowledge.</p><p>So, whether it’s in your career, your hobbies, or your personal growth, take action. Practice makes progress. The more you do, the more you’ll improve, and the more natural your new skills will become.</p><h4>Adapting to the Market</h4><p>Adapting to change isn’t just about staying relevant in your job — it’s about thriving in any environment you find yourself in. Whether you’re moving to a new city, shifting industries, or simply trying to stay up-to-date in your current role, adaptability is key.</p><p>Markets fluctuate. What’s popular today may be obsolete tomorrow. That’s why being flexible and open to change is crucial. For instance, the rise of tech startups and unicorn companies has put entrepreneurship and specialized skills in the spotlight. But remember, trends shift, and being adaptable keeps you competitive no matter what.</p><p>It’s not about being the best at one thing. It’s about being versatile — ready to pivot when necessary and able to bring more than one skill to the table.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>The ability to learn, do, and adapt will always be your greatest asset. In an ever-changing world, these three pillars form the foundation for long-term success and personal growth. Whether you’re just starting your journey or well into it, remember that progress comes from continuously evolving.</p><p>So, keep learning, keep doing, and always be willing to adapt. Your future self will thank you.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eac6bd67fd9b" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Tz1Ys4XHsb3hCJ3w" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@w18?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Claus Grünstäudl</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>While revisiting old files on my computer, I stumbled upon the transcript of a 2021 podcast episode I recorded with a close friend from Ireland. Even three years later, the conversation still resonates deeply with me, capturing the essence of our thoughts during the challenging COVID-19 era. It was a compelling read and I felt deserved to be shared with you all — a refined transcript of an inspiring dialogue from those unprecedented times.</p><p>Here’s the full podcast episode: <a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/aravindspeaks/episodes/Talking-Optimism-With-Robert-Arcaz-e176in4/a-a6givut">https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/aravindspeaks/episodes/Talking-Optimism-With-Robert-Arcaz-e176in4/a-a6givut</a></p><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> My first question is a personal one. I’ve seen you interact with many people effortlessly, always coming across as happy, helpful, hardworking, and charismatic. How do you manage to stay that way? What drives you forward?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> That’s a great question. I believe it takes time to discover what truly drives you, but once you find it, it stays with you for life. For me, music has been a personal motivator for as long as I can remember. It started with a simple interest — listening and going out with friends. I’d play music on Spotify at house gatherings before parties, and for years, it was just a fun hobby. Eventually, I began DJing and even tried my hand at making music.</p><p>Professionally, music helps me maintain balance. While I love it deeply, focusing solely on music would drive me crazy because, like anything in life, too much of one thing isn’t healthy. I’ve learned to balance my professional life, music, family, and friends. If one area falters, I still have the others to rely on. This balance is what keeps me grounded.</p><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> That’s truly inspiring. Robbie, I’ve interacted with you several times, and I must say, you’re consistently kind and a role model for how to treat others. We met randomly at a party, and since then, I’ve always admired your demeanor.</p><p>Now, my second question: 2020 was a tough year for many, with job losses and widespread suffering. Yet, some people thrived and became more competent, generous, and healthy. How was 2020 for you, and how did you navigate the challenges of the pandemic?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> It’s a complex question. As you pointed out, the pandemic affected people differently; some had a terrible time, while others found unexpected benefits. I believe the pandemic highlighted existing inequalities. Those fortunate enough to work from a quiet space at home might have found themselves more productive without the hassle of commuting. Meanwhile, others, especially those with families in cramped spaces or students without proper study areas, faced significant challenges.</p><p>I was privileged to have a peaceful environment to work from, but I also felt conflicted, knowing others weren’t as fortunate. To channel this energy positively, I focused on using my extra time to help others. Even small actions, though not world-changing, helped restore a sense of balance for me. I believe it’s important to look beyond our situations and consider the broader impact.</p><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> That’s a great perspective, Robert. Gratitude for what we have is essential. I also believe that when we’re in a good place, we’re better equipped to help others. Now, my third question: we all face challenges, both professionally and personally. Could you share a challenge you’ve encountered in the past decade and how you’re managing or planning to overcome it?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> One of my long-standing challenges has been the quest for the most effective way to make a difference. Once you understand the interconnectedness of the world and the need to protect it, you start questioning what you can personally do to contribute. My personality drives me to seek the most efficient ways to solve problems, whether that’s through my job in IT, working with local councils, or even considering a role in politics.</p><p>For years, I’ve been on this never-ending quest to find the perfect role that maximizes impact. I’ve realized that there’s no single “most efficient” job — you don’t need to be in a position of power to make a meaningful difference. It’s about doing what you can with the resources you have. This realization has helped me shift my focus from striving for perfection to making the best of my current opportunities.</p><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> That’s great advice, Robert. It’s important to balance ambition with self-compassion. My fourth question is on many people’s minds, especially with the disruptions in education: In 2021, is pursuing a master’s degree still worth it, especially when you can start working with just a bachelor’s?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> For me, pursuing a master’s was invaluable. I studied computer science and worked in IT for seven to eight years before realizing I wanted to understand the world more deeply, beyond technology. I felt a strong need to learn about politics, economics, and other complex global issues, which my background hadn’t covered. That’s why I decided to pursue a master’s — it was driven by a desire to learn, not just a career move.</p><p>Many people jump into master’s or MBA programs straight out of university, thinking it’s the key to a high-paying job. I believe a master’s is most beneficial when you have some work experience and know what you want to specialize in. It’s not just about financial returns; it’s about gaining knowledge and perspective that you can apply meaningfully in your career.</p><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> That’s insightful. Many pursue further education without a clear understanding of its purpose. What you shared will resonate with our readers. My final question is about friendships and relationships. Beyond skills and hard work, how much do you think these connections impact one’s well-being?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Relationships play a crucial role in our lives, whether they’re personal friendships or professional networks. Everyone needs a social life, but the nature and extent of that can vary. Some people thrive with just a few close friends, while others enjoy a wide circle. I fall into the latter category, partly because of my involvement in music and social events.</p><p>However, I’ve also found that maintaining many friendships can be demanding and sometimes stressful. It’s about finding what works for you. Professionally, building connections can be just as important. Offering help without expecting anything in return can lead to valuable opportunities down the road. Maintaining a healthy balance of personal and professional relationships can greatly enhance your overall well-being.</p><p>Thank you for reading!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d15c3bdd17e3" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zCGF0rPMpwz-cn75ugwVfA.png" /><figcaption>Celestial Wellness: Visualize the Universe of Wellbeing</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Don’t you feel like 2019 was just a year ago? I do.</blockquote><p>After giving it a thought, I realized how we take time for granted. Forget about time, most of us are not even prioritizing our well-being actively. As we live in this world of hustle and bustle, I’m certain that prioritizing your well-being can often feel like an elusive goal. Yet, amidst all the drama, I believe that we MUST pause, reflect, and nurture our physical, mental, and emotional health from time-to-time. From nourishing your body with nutritious foods to embracing mindfulness and gratitude, each suggestion in this blog aims to help you achieve a vibrant and fulfilling existence. My curiosity towards the potential hacks for wellbeing lead me to curate 24 simple yet powerful practices, that can elevate your overall well-being. Read through them yourself and lets embark on this journey together, as we together uncover the keys to unlocking a life of balance, joy, and vitality.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CwW7YswRvy866YG-KnVISg.png" /><figcaption>The 8 dimensions of wellbeing (Emotional, Intellectual, Occupational, Environmental, Physical, Spiritual, Financial, and Social)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Though all of these activities are relatively simple, please make sure you are being genuine, motivated, and aligned with the process of implementing them in your life. Welcome to the journey towards Celestial Wellness.</blockquote><ol><li><strong>Eat well:</strong></li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ON2Y5mjnBlewAOTlRL0BMQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>In India, we say that ‘’Food itself is <em>Brahma, the lord of creation.’’ </em>Designed by <a href="http://www.freepik.com">freepik</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>Have you ever considered how the food you eat affects not just your physical health, but also your overall well-being?</blockquote><p>Eating well isn’t just about satisfying hunger; it’s about nourishing your body and mind for optimal performance and happiness. I got married last year, and my eating habits changed a lot since then for good. From personal experience, I’ve come to understand the profound impact of a balanced diet on mood and mental clarity. By prioritizing nutritious foods, you’re not only providing your body with the essential fuel it needs, but you’re also enhancing your mood, sharpening your focus, and boosting your energy levels throughout the day. Incorporating colorful fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into your meals can make a world of difference in how you feel both physically and mentally. So, let’s make a conscious effort to choose foods that nourish us from the inside out. Whether it’s swapping out processed snacks for nutrient-rich alternatives or exploring new recipes that excite your taste buds and support your health goals, every small step toward better nutrition is a step toward a happier, healthier life. Let’s embark on this journey together and prioritize our well-being one meal at a time.</p><p><strong>2. Sleep Well:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/1*yP6U5hYnSraoiFnNFA5b3w.png" /><figcaption>Sleeping well is therapeutic. Designed by <a href="http://www.freepik.com">freepik</a></figcaption></figure><p>Getting enough sleep is super important for your overall health. When you take time to rest, your body and mind get the chance to recharge. Good sleep helps you feel balanced emotionally, so you can focus better, learn more, and make smart decisions. 💡 It also makes your immune system stronger, which means you’re less likely to get sick and recover faster if you do. Plus, sleeping well can make you feel happier, reduce stress, and make it easier to deal with everyday problems. Learning about good sleep habits can help you figure out what works best for you, so you can make it a regular part of your routine and feel even better!</p><blockquote>Every day before going to sleep, I prefer writing down a list of all the pending tasks in a notepad for me to act on the next day. This helps me relax and sleep peacefully.</blockquote><p><strong>3. Exercise:</strong></p><p>Exercise is seriously awesome for both our bodies and minds! When we get our bodies moving, it’s like giving them a super boost — keeping our muscles strong, our hearts pumping strong, and our bones as sturdy as can be. And guess what? It’s not just about physical stuff! Exercise actually makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside because it releases these amazing feel-good chemicals in our brains.</p><blockquote>Isn’t that cool?</blockquote><p>But wait, there’s more! Regular exercise isn’t just about feeling awesome during your workout — it’s also like a magic potion for better sleep. Yup, that’s right! Getting those workouts in can help us catch those Z’s better at night, so we can wake up feeling like we’ve been wrapped in a cozy blanket of restfulness, ready to tackle whatever the day throws at us.</p><p>So, whether it’s taking a leisurely stroll, shooting hoops with friends, or busting out some sweet dance moves in your bedroom, find something that makes you grin from ear to ear and get moving — it’s like giving yourself the biggest, happiest bear hug ever!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/1*4wY0egwLspLVc7pDtSfImw.png" /><figcaption>Exercise is where strength meets beauty and vitality blooms.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>4. Save Money:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/1*BKQ9pZMWVzT1IMr7A5Zj5A.png" /><figcaption>“The art is not in making money, but in keeping it.”</figcaption></figure><p>A lot of people think saving money is boring. But actually, it’s super important! Saving money means putting some aside from what you earn. It helps you stay safe financially and reach your big dreams, like traveling or buying a house. When you save, you’re ready for unexpected expenses or tough times without having to borrow money. Plus, it teaches you to be responsible with your cash. So, even if saving sounds a bit nerdy, it’s really cool because it gives you freedom to do what you want in the future!</p><p><strong>5. Earn Money:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UWcLY0mkDRALmXVSLzNp3w.jpeg" /><figcaption>“Don’t stay in bed unless you can make money in bed.”</figcaption></figure><p>I think we don’t talk enough about money, and it’s super important! We need money to pay for things like food, a place to live, and healthcare. Plus, earning money helps us support our families and reach our goals. When we make money, we can invest in education and learn new skills, which can help us get better jobs and have more opportunities. It also gives us the freedom to do things we love, like traveling or starting our own business. And when we earn money, it feels good because we know we’re doing a great job and taking care of ourselves. So, let’s talk about money more because it’s not just about having cash — it’s about making our lives better!</p><p><strong>6. Invest Money:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qGhvrFPuW1o_Lk07-PL5Sg.jpeg" /><figcaption>“Live within your means and Invest. Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it.”</figcaption></figure><p>Investing money is super important for making your money grow, reaching your financial goals, and securing a better future. When you put your money into things like stocks, bonds, or real estate, it has the chance to grow over time. This can happen through things like the value of what you’ve invested in going up or getting regular payments from your investments. Investing also helps you keep up with the rising cost of things over time. Plus, it teaches you to be smart with your money and learn about how the market works. If you invest wisely, you might even earn money without having to work for it, which gives you more financial freedom. So, by investing your money, you’re setting yourself up for a more secure and successful future where you can achieve your dreams and goals!</p><blockquote>I can assure you that idea of investing money is great, but believe me, it takes a lot of skill, patience, learning, and understanding to become a successful investor.</blockquote><p><strong>7. Donate Money:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6ocrhBSQesxBsu7rhQqS_A.jpeg" /><figcaption>“We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Recent research on the happiest countries of the world disclosed that all of the happiest countries across the globe have a few things in common. And one of them was generosity and charity. The survey clearly states that being generous, helping people, and doing charity is fundamental for people’s well-being and eventually lead to happiness.</blockquote><p>Donating money is essential for creating positive societal impact and make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. Moreover, donating money fosters a sense of empathy, compassion, and social responsibility, encouraging individuals to actively engage in their communities and contribute to the common good. Ultimately, donating money not only helps to address pressing social challenges but also brings fulfillment, purpose, and a sense of connection to something larger than oneself.</p><p><strong>8. Learn to Navigate through Emotions:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4dK-SDBzE9TQKYUTZ_wH7w.jpeg" /><figcaption>“Emotional intelligence is not about being nice all the time. It’s about being honest.”</figcaption></figure><p>Understanding and managing emotions is super important for navigating life smoothly. It’s a skill we all need to work on. Emotional intelligence helps us handle social situations well, resolve conflicts, and work together with others easily. I truly believe that being aware of our emotions and those of others is key to building good relationships and communicating effectively, leading to personal growth. When we’re in tune with our feelings, we can handle stress better, make smart decisions, and understand ourselves better, which is good for our overall well-being. So, let’s embrace emotional intelligence to create harmony, understanding, and growth in both our personal and professional lives.</p><blockquote>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to manage your own emotions while understanding the emotions of people around you. Improve yours for better.</blockquote><p><strong>9. Seek Wisdom:</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7w87Oh8bLS97zpCE3DFbFg.jpeg" /><figcaption>“To acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe.” Designed by <a href="http://www.freepik.com">freepik</a></figcaption></figure><p>Seeking wisdom is fundamental for growth and navigating life’s complexities with clarity and understanding. Learning to be wise helps us grow and handle life better. It lets us make good choices, understand things better, and care about others. When we seek wisdom, we learn more about ourselves and the world. This helps us face tough times with strength and kindness. Trying to be wise makes our lives more meaningful and happy, and it helps us make the world a better place for everyone.</p><p><strong>10. Find your Purpose</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WuktEYgrxVAiwOPVAOlrPg.jpeg" /><figcaption>‘’The purpose of our lives is to be happy, useful, honorable, and compassionate’’</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Having a purpose makes you excited to do good things for others and build stronger relationships.</blockquote><p>Discovering your purpose gives your life a strong foundation. It helps you know where you’re going, what drives you, and makes you feel satisfied. When you find your purpose, you can set goals that really matter, work hard, and keep going even when things get tough. Knowing your purpose helps you bounce back from hard times and stay focused. It also makes life more meaningful and enjoyable, which is good for your mental health. I believe that finding your purpose not only makes your life better but also makes the world a better place for everyone.</p><p><strong>11. Connect with Family &amp; Friends More Often</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5_QOWmXTzlEejG9_OS3Iew.jpeg" /><figcaption>“Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe or a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.” Designed by <a href="http://www.freepik.com">freepik</a></figcaption></figure><p>Spending time with family and friends is super important for feeling like you belong somewhere and having people who care about you. They’re the ones who give you love and support when things are going great or when they’re tough.

Even when you have a great support system and an extended family that cares about you, you’d still go through this feeling of misery, insecurity, and loneliness. It would be way worse if you lose any of your parents to suicide. I know that and the research proves that. Now, that’s one tough circumstance I had to experience in my early childhood, and perhaps that’s what made me become who I am today; an introvert who loves books and fancies content on the Internet over communication IRL. Now, there are over seven billion people in the world that go through some sort of difficulty, shame, guilt, and sometimes trauma. It’s just the levels that vary.</p><p>Coming to the author Lewis Howes, he publicly said that he was sexually abused when he was a kid. And from that point, his journey to becoming one of the most valued entrepreneurs and podcasters in the country of the United States was an inspiring story. My first introduction to Lewis Howes was through one of his podcast episodes. In fact, it was an informative and educative interview he did, and it was great. His storytelling inspired me to do better, and I remember searching for his podcast on the same night. It was half a decade ago, when I was in Ireland. I was 27, living in Ireland around half a decade ago. However, one of the core reasons for me to start listening to podcasts was simple: to communicate fluently.</p><p>Going back to Lewis Howes’ podcast, The School Of Greatness, it’s where I listened to one of the most successful people, and a lot of influencers, entrepreneurs, and life coaches I follow on social today. My interest in podcasting grew over the years through him, his show, and his podcast guests. The School of Greatness is still, to this day, one of the most successful and active podcasts in the world. Later on, I got hooked on audiobooks. I used to listen to shorter versions of audiobooks during my commute to work. And that’s when I came across the book ‘’Mask of Masculinity’’.</p><h4>Author’s Introduction:</h4><p>LEWIS HOWES is a New York Times Bestselling author of the hit book, The School of Greatness. He is a lifestyle entrepreneur, high-performance business coach, and keynote speaker. A former professional football player and two-sport All-American, he is a current USA Men’s National Handball Team athlete. He hosts a top 100 iTunes-ranked podcast, The School of Greatness, which has over 100 million downloads and over 1300 episodes since it launched in 2013. The White House and President Obama recognized Lewis as one of the top 100 entrepreneurs in the country under 30. Details Magazine called him one of the “5 Internet Gurus that can Make You Rich.” Lewis is a contributing writer for Entrepreneur and has been featured on Ellen, The Today Show, The New York Times, People, Forbes, Inc, Fast Company, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Men’s Health, and other major media outlets.</p><h3><strong>Book Review:</strong></h3><p>The book Mask of Masculinity comprises 11 major chapters on Audible and is over 6 hours. The book starts off with an introduction into Lewis Howes’ childhood, his beliefs into what a real man is. Mostly, it’s about working hard and being tough. And he described why it didn’t work for him to find his happier self and why the ideology is not as real as it’s told. He addressed the driving factors for violence, depression and suicides in men, and his desire to help with the help of this book. The book discusses the masks that we men wear to hide our emotions or to confront or transition through a situation and elaborates on the idea of becoming free from all these masks and live our lives greatly by being true to ourselves. Lewis mentioned it clearly that it’s not lecturing or criticising, but to come up with a helpful resource for you to become a better version of yourself. And after the whole book, it’s safe to say that I agree with that. We all have our own ideologies, an opinion, and a definition of what a man is, and that’s where the book helps men to be more of themselves and not to abide by the unrealistic ideologies and the standards that would suffer them long time.</p><p>In Lewis’ words, we all have our own insecurities and fears. And intentionally or unintentionally, we cover up our insecurities, our vulnerabilities, mostly in fear. The interesting part for me was when Lewis said how he could come to this place of understanding. He said it was by asking thoughtful questions. By asking questions, he could investigate the nine masks that we the men often wear. And the masks he mentioned were The Stoic mask, where we hide our emotions and show toughness, The Athlete mask, where we often carry our self-esteem by the time spent in the gym, believing that only an outstanding athlete is a good man. Material mask is where our self worth depends on our bank account. The sexual mask, where we put the number of women we slept with on a pedestal rather than how good the relationship was. The aggressive mask, where we constantly tell ourselves to not back down. The joker mask, where we nurture self-worth with sarcasm, cynicism, and find our superiority. The invincible mask, where we act like it’s all under control even when it’s not. The ‘’Know-It-All’’ mask, where we try or dominate intellectually, and project that we will never need help. Finally, the Alpha mask where we segregate men into either winners or losers, the Alphas or Betas.</p><p>And Lewis did great by providing insights and consequences into each mask with the help of real-life experiences, from the genuine conversations he had with people, friends, and mentors. The fact that he could come with examples either from his past or from his friends was top-notch. He really digged deep. The whole listening experience was outstanding. For me, it was nothing different to listening to a spiritual guru preach. In fact, it’s more effective as it’s coming from the current real-life experiences. Overall, it is encouraging, educative, and moving, to be honest.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I did not choose the book mask of masculinity by accident. As someone who hosts a podcast, creates content for good, it’s my job to either become a resource or to provide something value to my listeners. With 85% of our podcast listeners being men under 35, I thought it’s important and helpful to bring this book into the conversation. Even if you are a woman, I still recommend this book as it has the potential to help you understand the men in your life better, forever.</p><p>For me, a perfect man is not something that truly exists. However, I think that we all need to realize that asking for help, being kind, showing emotions, nurturing relationships, is a few better things we can dream and do for the rest of our lives. Personally, this book is really special to me because it helped me to introspect myself throughout these masks, the situations, the beliefs, not in a judgemental way but with a caring perspective. My firm belief is that introspection should lead us to do more, and this book delivers that by educating about the situations all men face. Overall, the book gives you a humbling experience and I will definitely recommend you to read it.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d097150d26e9" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

We worked together in an MNC as Human Resource Practitioners. Debi is a senior HR analyst working with an MNC in Bangalore. He’s done his MBA in Operations HR, from Ravenshaw University Cuttack, and did his bachelor&#39;s in Technology in Civil engineering from Gandhi Institute of Excellent technocrats. Debi is a big-time Gym freak and loves movies, especially movies from all over India, and he’s into traveling and he loves motorbikes and huge Salman Khan fan.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*rp1vkaPk-19wa_Qi0NrMdA.jpeg" /></figure><h3>Q&amp;A:</h3><blockquote>Q1: I have seen you at work &amp; I am fond of the way you work too. Once the clock goes off, you are head down, all in, and be productive for the people who need you. So, could you explain what work ethic means to you in your words?</blockquote><p>Firstly, thank you for saying that. I am happy to hear that because I believe in my work ethic. I do believe in work ethic in general. I put my head down and work because I know there’s someone at the other end waiting for me &amp; I know that there is no substitute for hard work. But if you ask me about the way I do it, I do it by working on 5 things consistently.</p><blockquote>Professionalism, Respect, Responsibility, Reliability, &amp; Determination.</blockquote><p>i) In my opinion, professionalism is not limited to top corporate jobs. It applies to every job. I see a lot of professionals being productive but not professional. Whatever you are doing, you can do it with morals. When you are getting paid, you are getting paid for being productive and also for your professionalism.</p><p>ii) Respect is good. I feel that your words and actions will have a huge impact on others. For example, I see people be very polite and respectful towards clients, managers, and their bosses and not towards subordinates. Be respectful towards everyone, and be supportive and attentive towards your subordinates.</p><p>iii) For me, responsibility is a big deal &amp; much needed to grow. I honestly can’t sleep, if I don’t finish my job for today. Especially if I ever fail to finish my job for the day, due to negligence or ignorance, I don’t get good sleep.</p><p>iv) You are reliable when you make and keep your commitments. You are reliable when you complete your tasks in an accurate and timely manner and I am always working to get better at it.</p><p>v) I would say, always focus on yourself. If you ever fail at something, practice and get better at it. Tell yourself, without me this work is not achievable. And always work hard to achieve something for yourself and for your organization.</p><blockquote>Q2: Undoubtedly, you are one of the folks who are all in about working out as well. So, could you tell me what working out &amp; physical fitness mean to you &amp; how someone new can approach the gym in your words?</blockquote><p>Thanks for this question, I am into working out personally. It started a long time ago and I am still going for it. Because I feel that having control over your body saves you from a lot of trauma or overthinking. I always had a quote that drives me, my mantra for working out. ‘’The pain you feel today, is the strength you feel tomorrow.’’</p><p>I would say, going to the gym and working out are 2 different things. You can stay home, work out and still get fit, and be in shape. Working out at home is a huge possibility to get fit and be in shape.</p><blockquote>Q3. Can you share your story about how you overcame challenges during Covid and what did you learn from it?</blockquote><p>Well, Covid was rough. I was in Orissa at my home. I was working in the construction field at the time and I was doing well, both financially and also emotionally. It all changed very quickly, I became jobless and anxious. I was the guy who is leading a relatively lavish lifestyle and went into bad tune almost in an instant.</p><p>Yet, that was also the time I decided to get into the corporate world as I was also pursuing my MBA on the side. So, I started applying for jobs in my domain. I remember applying for 60–70 jobs at one point and went to the last round and got rejected at least 25–30 times. Well, I got a job later on and then I didn’t stop.</p><p>What I learned from it was to be more watchful with money. It taught me to face the challenges head-on instead of sitting there and complaining. It taught me the importance of investing and being prepared for adversities. There could be another pandemic in the coming years, but I am ready to face it better now.</p><blockquote>Q4. Do you think being optimistic help? What do you think of optimism &amp; how do you see it?</blockquote><p>I like optimism. For me optimism is the fuel to see beauty in every little thing and in every adversity. I always loved the idea of having an iPhone, I worked hard for it and bought it. That’s how I see it, you can be optimistic but you have to work to achieve what you want in your life.</p><p>Optimism is not just dreaming, it lives in action. Optimism seeks solutions to problems and challenges we may face in the future. I think the optimism that’s grounded in gratitude is a huge strength. Personally, I am grateful, I think positively, I believe it’s possible, and I stay fearless.</p><blockquote>Q5. If there’s a young graduate, or a jobseeker reading this, what would your suggestion be and why do you think it works?</blockquote><p>Well, firstly I am an HR professional and I deal with jobseekers day to day. It is my job and I come from my learned and practiced experience and that’s how and why I believe what I am about to say works for a job seeker.</p><p>First, I would tell them to be proactive and start doing something rather than staying idle. Take up a course related to their domain, and keep learning. There are so many free resources available to engage in.</p><p>As mentioned, it’s a refined transcript. If you would like to listen to him more on the topic, please listen to the podcast episode embedded at the top of this blog.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=78e4b1889659" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BXpoGqQsPcHGhuXl2CAevw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/colin00b-346653/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1125016">Colin Behrens</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1125016">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure><p>In today’s exponentially advancing world in 2022, most of us human beings by default are dreaming big &amp; better. We know that we have plenty of options, we have better medical care, we have better technology, we have better education, and collectively we are in the most optimistic era of human development.</p><p>Except for the issues such as global warming and a few other major concerns, we are living in the most developed &amp; convenient world. The majority of the technology advancements we are enjoying today, including the Internet, were developed a few decades ago. And I often wonder how some of us forget the fact that human beings were not equipped to communicate with friends and family living abroad just a couple of decades ago.</p><p>The older generations never had the chance to upskill themselves once they hit their 30s, or rarely had the opportunities to grow. And contrary to that, today’s technological advancements are giving us an enormous amount of convenience to learn new things and pursue a fulfilling career irrespective of our age, gender, and location. Upskilling and landing your dream role is not as challenging as it was once. Any passionate individual can even learn basic rocket science on the Internet for free at their convenience.</p><p>Taking into consideration the opportunities available today for you to do what you truly love, here are my 6 tips to sustain a happier life, progress, and perform in your dream role.</p><h3><strong>Eliminate comparisons &amp; start collaborating with others.</strong></h3><p>It is a gift to be able to wake up every day and do what you love. I lived it during my time in hospitality. And I am certain that there is nothing that beats being happy with your work, your role, and your responsibilities. However, most of us get caught up in comparisons and get distracted and lose the zeal, lose the charm once we had to pursue our passion. And most of the time, the distractions are money, or perks, or convenience. There is nothing wrong with making huge financial leaps, but choosing a career or changing your career purely based on financial gains is insanely vulnerable.</p><p><strong><em>It is not sustainable if you don’t enjoy what you do daily.</em></strong></p><p>So, if you’ve already got into the role you love, start eliminating comparisons from day 1. Your younger cousin or that friend from college making more money should never be the reason for you to distract yourself from what you truly love doing. In simple words, financial growth alone can never be the sustainable gateway to a progressive career and a happier life.</p><p>Once you believe in collaborations and start interacting with your friends who are making more money instead of envying them, your life changes significantly and your vision becomes a reality. By collaborating with people from different crafts and who are in the most admirable positions, you will ultimately be solving complex problems that are beyond your potential.</p><h3><strong>Socialize with people you admire.</strong></h3><p>Socializing plays a vital role in our emotional well-being. Taking your time to meet friends and family helps you significantly. It ensures we stay the course, look forward to the future, and be grateful for everything that we have. Once you start making money by working in your dream role, socializing with the people you admire all the way through will truly make you align with growth and progression. It could be the people you want to be like, the people who have helped you in the past, or simply friends and family.</p><p>Socializing with the people you love the most will put you in the best spot, both mentally, as well as financially. As long as you are not going overboard, not doing things that are unhealthy, every one of these interactions will come off as gold dust for you to dream bigger and grow healthier from a financial standpoint.</p><h3><strong>Nurture your relationship with money.</strong></h3><p>Personal finance plays a major role in one’s growth. It is still one of the most talked-about subjects among youth, especially after such a devastating pandemic experience. Similar to every other craft, it needs discipline and takes a lot of hard work to become financially independent. From my personal experience, it is what you are doing with the money that represents you more than how much you are earning.</p><p>And my suggestions for a healthy financial routine are to start living within your means and saving money each month and investing in the assets that you truly love, the ones that bring you joy and keep you motivated. Plain and simple yet they truly are the game-changers. Most of us often get caught up in this dream of financial freedom and forget the importance of the little steps and underestimate the power of compounding.</p><h3><strong>Believe in hard work &amp; upskilling.</strong></h3><p>We have come a long way when it comes to building tools that do all the hard work for us. Be it manufacturing a motorcycle, or a calculator, we created the need for people to know how to use these tools and we labeled it as smart work. You can stick to your thought process, however, talent alone will never be enough whether it’s in physical activity or mental activity, the more you train yourself the better you become.</p><p><strong><em>You can always learn better ways to do the work, however, talent without hard work will not lead to anything great.</em></strong></p><p>The more you are willing to learn the skillset and the more you put in the hours in your craft, the better especially if you want to achieve greater results. Self-belief is always underrated in reality, but it is one core attribute we all should master if we want to make ourselves progress along with the rest of the world.</p><h3><strong>Practice Gratitude.</strong></h3><p>Most of the unhappiness in the world is a development of a lack of gratitude. We are all chasing our dreams and ambitions every day. Though it is important, somewhere in the process we are forgetting to appreciate the current. We are forgetting to appreciate all of the sacrifices our loved ones have made, and the work our parents have put in and we are forgetting to notice the struggles everyone else is going through.</p><p>The world unemployment rate increased in the last couple of years, and there are still people who cannot afford clean water and yes they are living in the same world as we do. So, the fact that you can read this blog already puts you in a privileged place and for some reason, we are forgetting that.</p><p>Once we start practicing gratitude for what we have; our life becomes so much better. It is the time to forgive our mistakes, stop envying others and start being grateful for what we have.</p><h3><strong>Volunteer For A Charity.</strong></h3><p>Recent research on the happiest countries of the world disclosed that all of the happiest countries across the globe have a few things in common. And one of them was generosity and charity. The survey clearly states that being generous, helping people, and doing charity is fundamental for people’s well-being and eventually lead to happiness.</p><p><strong><em>Happy employees will not quit jobs and in fact, happy people attract good things in life.</em></strong></p><p>When you volunteer for a charity, be it by providing monetary benefits to your local old age home or by spending time working for them you make yourself exposed to noble-mindedness. When you elevate your mind to focus on doing things that make a difference, you either find your purpose or improve your worldview.</p><p>Here are a few more things that help you sustain yourself in your dream role.</p><blockquote>1. Master yourself in the associated tools and technology.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Focus on your strengths, and build them.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Always pay attention to the new updates, and trends among the younger generation in the craft.</blockquote><blockquote>4. Create content about the things you lover on the Internet, and build your personal brand.</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ad6d3378e8f6" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>An honest take from my personal experiences.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*41djXZG5OyKnRlJ4bH-z0w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/congerdesign-509903/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4600757">congerdesign</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4600757">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure><p>The first quarter of 2020 was a critical time for me. After six years of working in hospitality, I returned to India, and the whole industry had come to stall. I had a goal, and there were opportunities, and I was upskilling myself, yet nothing mattered to the market. So, I did what I could. I took a job that served my needs at the time. I started working as social media and recruiting associate with a startup. And if I could remember it, it was when I started writing on Medium.com. And to this day, I feel grateful for that opportunity and am happy to sustain through the pandemic without losing much energy.</p><p>At the time, I was new to writing and still am. I worked as a freelance social media guide for a couple of months, creating content and setting up pages across the social and later moved into recruiting as it was the core of the organization I was working with. As a social media guy new in the country, I had to stay curious about the platforms and content that work for the organization. I was reading books and interacting with social media consultants from different companies to upskill myself. And in late 2020, during my research, I came across a blog from “TED.”</p><p>I followed TED for almost a decade, reading blogs and listening to the talks. I found the information interesting, thoughtful, and usable. Now, the blog I read was about literature and fiction. I barely got through my graduation in computer science, worked in hospitality for almost six years, and literature was never my learned skill. I was curious about storytelling as a marketing tact. But I never approached it through academic knowledge. Fiction, literature, and storytelling weren’t the skills I prepared. However, that blog I read on TED that day completely changed my course of action for the last two years.</p><p>The blog concluded that fiction is suitable for people’s mental health. I wholeheartedly wanted to do something about it. One way to contribute was by telling fictitious stories yet so real in 2022. I chose the theme. A little girl and her pet. And their journey to become social media influencers. I am convinced that I want to tell this story and the characters I chose were from Ireland, where I lived and worked for six years for most of my professional career. To keep it simple, during my stay in Ireland, I have had the opportunity to attend events that are deeply rooted in art &amp; culture. I worked in the food business, which helped me to interact with people who were at least 30 years older than me, and at the same time, at least 15 years younger than me, a diverse demographic. And I was fortunate to meet founders, entrepreneurs, and operators who were into art — especially a CEO who comes from theatre art &amp; also the most futuristic technology domain. I made quite a few good friends over there who are into art.</p><p>I think Ireland is one such country that’s deeply rooted in poetry &amp; and also competing in today’s technology evolution. And that led me to get into fiction, write stories and independently publish my first storybook. There are other things too that inspired me to write a novel. I ended up with a conclusion to write something that could help someone understand the good aspects of social media and the people who are celebrating the success of it and success. As a millennial, my most important researched topic was social media and Gen-Z. I chose the platform Wattpad knowing that most consumers out there fall under the same demography. My journey as an author was lively.<br>My storybook was trending at the top for a while on Wattpad. I was able to participate in a competition and have a conversation with fellow writers. Finally, I could tap into my fascination to become a writer and collaborate with people across the globe. Sometimes it was for editing or the artwork or inspiration. It was super satisfying for the wannabe writer in me. I mentioned somewhere on social that writing this storybook made me feel like a protagonist in real life.</p><blockquote>Now, let’s talk about fiction.</blockquote><p>From my own experience, reading fiction and indulging myself in literature taught me a few things. First, it made me feel we are not acting like protagonists in real life, at least myself. Whether watching a movie, or a documentary, we all love it when the good guy beats the bad guy and the protagonist saves another human being from evil. We love it when the supermans &amp; spidermans fight and destroy evil &amp; even in YouTube videos; we love it when people help a homeless person; we love it when someone pays for an older person in the grocery store. We are prone to put ourselves in the protagonist’s shoes most of the time. However, in reality, I don’t think we are acting on it.</p><p>We all have bills to pay, aspirations to chase, families to feed and, we are all competing, we are competing to get what is ours, and somehow during the process, I believe that we are somewhat losing our human side. We are trading our humanity for more cash, comfort, and luxury. That’s where fiction comes in handy for the welfare of human kinds. Let me clarify: I love competition and grew up being a notorious cricket fan. Even when playing against friends and cousins, I enjoyed the competition; I always went for the W. There were heated arguments, and we did not talk with each other for days over the game. I am 100% for the competition; it’s adrenaline, the thrill. Still to this day, I love a good match. I mentioned good because today, we compete to the extent that we forget to care about others.</p><blockquote>As someone who’s living in 2022, I feel like we are lacking love and kindness. And the fiction makes me believe that we can only win in life with love and compassion more than with hate &amp; fear. There is a great need for all of us to lead with love &amp; kindness rather than to lead with fear and hate hatred is possible to lead and win in life for the greater good. Literature plays a significant role in shaping ourselves, whether poetry or novels; I believe the more we indulge ourselves in it, the better human beings we become.</blockquote><p>Talking about literature, I will say one thing confidently. Without literature, there are very few chances for us to understand each other, our culture, and today’s reality. I believe literature is the epitome of human evolution; we are leaving future generations the pathway, learning our ancient methodologies, and building ourselves to become better with it every day. Unfortunately, in a world where the youth are chasing custom-made ancient practices, there is a higher possibility of failing to receive the significant results they promise. I don’t blame people or institutions that appreciate beer, disco, or hot yoga. Still, we must understand that ancient yoga is far more beneficial and immensely superior.</p><p>And you can only gain knowledge from the literature. Be it about becoming a better businessman, an athlete, and even better human being. So many people decided to leave all these influential writings for us to live a better life. I think we are overvaluing our time and overestimating what we are up to. If you aren’t into literature, your time will become unworthy, unrealistic, and unbelievably disappointing. So, it’s time for us to go through the books we want, only for our betterment. If you are not into literature, there will be fewer opportunities to grow healthy, kind, and skillful. Without literature, we will lose opportunities and the potential to become the most excellent version of ourselves. Moreover, literature teaches us empathy &amp; without empathy, we are only heading toward destruction.</p><blockquote>And the way I see it is that learning programming is incredible. Learning how to operate a machine that will help us is super awesome. Yet, if you aren’t leaning into history, ancient mythology, and fiction, you will be far off from being able to understand the human in front of you. So how could we ignore the most precious machine we all have, which helps us every second, our body and mind?</blockquote><p>Literature influences us to appreciate the good in others and the interest in ourselves. Overall, as human beings, we need each other to overcome challenges and live a truly blessed life. So if I have to recommend a book, I will tell you to start reading the sacred texts from your religion. Start there, and I believe they will teach you all you got to know about the history and the fundamental thought process for thinking about what is good and evil. I am not talking about the way you consume it and the vehicle through which you do it. You could listen to your parents tell you a story, you could go and buy that sacred book, or you could listen to a podcast episode, or even a YouTube video from a peer-reviewed publication can come in handy.</p><p>If I have learned anything from reading and writing, fiction or literature, it is that we all are prone to making mistakes. We all are prone to believing our own experiences and are apt to become stubborn and heavy-headed. So, we must ground ourselves consistently on different levels, and we can do it by falling in love with fiction and literature.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c194a1c04f6b" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>My first-hand experience with Oculus Quest and meeting Camille Donegan, one of the independent VR producers from the country of Ireland.</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8l47x_At1-_n471pCGcZtQ.jpeg" /></figure><blockquote><strong><em>First, let me give you a comprehensive context into the read.</em></strong></blockquote><p>This story is a remembrance from the year 2019. The time when I was working as a restaurant in charge of one of the fanciable restaurants in the south of Dublin, Ireland managing daily operations, leading the team on busy days, accommodating customers daily.</p><p>Needless to say that my role was well-rounded. I used to work mostly five days a week and at times more, from 4 in the evening to 11 pm till night. I was a post-graduate in computer science who have enjoyed working in the restaurant domain. Moreover, it took me almost five years to ladder up in the organization. Along with the joy of being promoted up the ladder, there was also a little anxiety to perform flawlessly at the highest level.</p><p>First and foremost, the role itself was a learning experience, with an opportunity to garner insights while being encountered with new challenges every day. On top of that, I kept myself engaged with learning and understanding modern-day business development practices from everywhere else, including social media.</p><blockquote>If you manage people or lead a team, always remember that ‘you’ work for your team and not the other way around.</blockquote><p>This one piece of advice I came across on the internet made so much sense. If you are the manager, it’s your job to look after your team’s well-being. With that being said, I also understood that being good at the role requires having common sense, be well-informed, and live around the corners of opportunities. The more I understood my role as in charge, the more I started attending events in Dublin.</p><p>At that point, my singular agenda was to meet as many new people as I can in networking events, and pay attention to where the world is moving. Moreover, I have already made the decision to use my free time in knowing where the opportunities are, and what skill sets are required, so that I could go back to my workplace and be the guide and mentor for my team. In fact, learning how to do my job right did put me in the edges and in the action.</p><p>During that period, I made myself accept the changes and undertake plenty of creative hobbies. Hobbies such as seeking knowledge, meeting new people, attending events, listening to podcasts, going on vacations, working persistently, nurturing my body. Along with that, I somehow made myself stay young and relevant to all the colleagues for the most part.</p><blockquote>In my opinion,</blockquote><blockquote>People in senior-level roles must always be able to accommodate their team. Having a vision for their subordinates is the most important thing the leaders can focus on. If the managers aren’t creating a sustainable environment for their talent pool, they will lose. It is as simple as that.</blockquote><p>And being a computing graduate and listening to the best of the ideologies such as the above helped me stay curious about having a vision for the people who work with me.</p><p>The things I put my head around at that time were simple,</p><blockquote>Work for the logo and your team.</blockquote><blockquote>Happy teams achieve more.</blockquote><blockquote>Mental health is important.</blockquote><blockquote>Learning is exhausting and underrated so be the best example you can ever be.</blockquote><blockquote>Be on the edge, stay on the lookout for what is working in the industry and everywhere else.</blockquote><blockquote>Encourage hobbies such as reading, listening, speaking, and writing.</blockquote><blockquote>Act like a superhero whenever possible, because sometimes all they need is hope.</blockquote><blockquote>Be okay with failing.</blockquote><p>Forgiving myself for the mistakes was fundamental throughout the process. I have been to events such as book launches, business conferences, language exchange meets, job expos, art festivals, and I travelled too. Gathering information, meeting new people, learning new crafts, figuring out the future of work.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TlVI1AX539pKCIZztpthaQ.png" /></figure><p>The world in Dublin is exuberant. From musicals and historicals to technological advancements there are plenty of opportunities for everyone to indulge in. Thanks to social media and the internet, finding these events is immensely easy. One fine day I was glancing through the list of events that are happening in the coming week and saw these pop up on my Facebook page. My initial reaction was, oh people here are talking VR passport? It sounded super cool already and then there was more. Firstly, I personally know plenty of kids who would love to own a VR headset, now I have this opportunity to experience it. In addition, they’re also talking about Technology Immersion in Businesses and that itself compelled me in deciding to spend few hours of my Tuesday (Day off) with the Digital Hub Ireland.</p><p>Reached Digital Hub’s cluster at around 11:45 pm. There were 2 kids alongside me, we together navigated ourselves into the building and reached the office space. There was a 1200 square feet gaming lounge specially designed for VR tryouts. You can sense how I felt being with the 11-year-olds for this event called VR passport. We were given the headsets and explained what we can do with them. There were gaming apps installed and we have given the controllers and assurance to try out everything we like and could.</p><p>I remember there are games like beat saber, and apps like YouTube VR, and Google Maps VR and so many more. It was the first time I tried VR and it was awesome. I was so busy enjoying the experience and they actually let me be there for 2 hours, it was supposed to be an hour thing.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*06_nEiiNPpn3EXwwWmU2WA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Camille Donegan giving us the attendees demos of #VR tailored to our interests (business progression).⁦</figcaption></figure><p>The induction started off with an explanation about what is majorly happening in the virtual reality space, all over the globe with regard to business success. As soon as I walked into the room, I remember there was a lady waiting in the room. We had a casual conversation for few minutes till the point where I got to know who the person I was talking to was. She was none other than Camille Donegan, General Manager and a producer of the company Virtual Reality Ireland. Camille was a very well-known individual in the virtual reality world, especially in Ireland. She has excelled parallelly in the Information Technology domain as well as in the literature &amp; arts discipline.</p><p><strong><em>Fun Fact:</em></strong></p><blockquote><em>Above all, it was a free event &amp; I haven’t paid a cent to be there. Just so you know, learning doesn’t always need to be expensive. There are plenty of worthy events that are happening in the world for free and it was one of those.</em></blockquote><p>Camille and the team of Digital Hub impacted us the technology &amp; business enthusiasts, by demonstrating how VR can transform the way we do things, especially in business. We have been explained about the wide range of areas where Virtual Reality can come in handy in the near future. A couple of examples I remember were, how patients and the elderly can use VR services to feel safe, and how countries can use them for security forces, and how businesses and even doctors can help people sustain well in the upcoming technology-centric world. Basically, they have illustrated to us how it is being done in a realistic way, deciphering the tech trend to generalists like myself. Camille came up with slideshows that demonstrate a couple of the case studies they have previously worked on.</p><p>For instance, they helped us understand it by letting us experience a first-person view of their work for an insurance company called FBD Insurance and another for a plumbing company called Woodies. According to those case studies, ‘’VR for training’’ is already a successful execution. As I mentioned earlier, by participating in their induction event, I have gained the opportunity to experience the actuality behind the concept of ‘’VR for Training’’. When these two companies, FBD Insurance and Woodies experienced problems with their employees needing reassurance for their lack of knowledge about the customer queries and operations, the Virtual Reality of Ireland has trained the employees by using VR on how to use the products.</p><p>I was blown away by the fact that people who received training in virtual reality for their company and customers have achieved a lot more confidence and accuracy while performing in their roles. In fact, As a part of the event, we were all given the same training that the employees undertook. We all wore the newly released Oculus Quest at the time and received first-person training on how to do the work in hand respectively. I have to tell you, I was never familiar with any sort of plumbing work my whole life but that VR experience made me feel like, I can actually do it without any more training. It took me approximately 10 minutes to feel immensely confident about plumbing.</p><p>We have put on the VR headsets two times and gained two different experiences. One was taking a customer inquiry call for FBD Insurance company, and the other one is fixing a tap for Woodies. It was surreal, I just felt like I was in the physical space of FBD insurance company, reporting, addressing, and solving a complex customer query. I called that experience surreal because, until that point, I was only looking at VR from a gaming standpoint as a wannabe gamer.</p><p>Moreover, on both of these occasions, the people who were trained in VR experienced growth in their confidence while selling their products and speaking to their customers, answering queries and complaints. The practical experience about how to use the products they sell in a virtual reality environment helped the employees worked more efficiently according to the companies. One of the most significant advantages of using VR for training according to what I learned from was employees will gain practical knowledge, they will obtain their training in a safer place without having any time constraints.</p><p>If you are interested in knowing more about this, Virtual Reality Ireland has their case studies on VR for Marketing, VR for Tourism, VR for events, and more on their website. They’re on fleek and after gaining some first-person experience, these things make a lot of sense to me and the event itself has given all of us an idea about the future of work from a better perspective.</p><p>Recommended Links :</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.virtualreality.ie/about.html">About</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thedigitalhub.com/event/immersive-technology-week-at-the-digital-hub-this-november/">Immersive Technology Week at The Digital Hub this November - The Digital Hub</a></li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7ff5083b538d" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wvbEtQqXDB6sJlxUQUycEg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Right from my childhood, I was fascinated by the daily routine of people in their 30s. By people in their 30s I mean, the ones who have finished their education and no longer studying and got into a workplace, or doing businesses, selling stuff, making money on a daily basis. The main reason was that I hated going to school. It just felt like a punishment to me. We were living in a small town in the southern part of India, and every time I walk past the streets on my way to school, there were these people I know, working in a shop or opening their stores. I indeed wanted to become an adult and start working as soon as possible, only to stop going to school every day. That is how I was wired at the age of 7. However, Marie Kondo, the author of the book ‘’Life-Changing Magic of Tidying’’ has a peculiar story from her childhood too.</p><p><strong>Author‘s Introduction — <em>Marie Kondo</em></strong></p><p>Marie Kondo was born in Tokyo, Japan and is currently living in Los Angeles, USA. As a young kid, Marie was obsessed with organizing. While all her friends that age is happily playing, Marie loved to spend her time organizing bookshelves. From her own words, her love for organizing and tidying started at the age of 5 and her story of living with four other family members in a tiny house in Japan and her idealistic approach to life in Japan. It was great to learn about the fact that the Japanese Lifestyle is more indistinguishable from minimalistic living. Marie Kondo remembers that she fell in love with reading lifestyle magazines at a very young age and used to practice making their home look organized and tidy, basically every day. Kondo today is a world-renown expert in decluttering, organizing. She is an organizing consultant and has written 4 books. Kondo was once listed as one of the Top 100 Influential people in the world by TIMES Magazine, and she also hosts a show about tidying on Netflix. After getting married, she moved to the United States of America and is currently living with her family in Los Angeles.</p><h3>Book Review:</h3><p>From the sort of complaints and requests, she undertakes on a day to day to how and why to organize your surroundings, Marie Kondo’s Life-Changing Magic of Tidying is one book that has the potential to help and transform an unorganized person into a decluttered, and productive human being. Every single page consisted of an easier explanation about why is it important to declutter and how to easily and effectively transform your home into a place that sparks joy.</p><p>The book has 5 chapters and is 250 pages long, 241 to be exact. I would like to ask you one thing straight, when was the last time you have seen a young person with a deeper love to put her or his time and effort into cleaning their room and surroundings. I did not see a single person who has attention to detail when it comes to their surroundings. I am not complaining, it is just that Marie Kondo is truly different from the people I met. Including myself, I believe that we all love to be carefree at a young age, and most of the ties, we take all the hard work our parents do at our homes for granted. Cleaning a room, keeping the shelves organized, being involved in housework is not cool for a teenager to do in my experience. Keeping the home organized and tidy is an impossible task even for a lot of homemakers. Marie Kondo admits that it is not an easy job to keep your house tidy and as any experienced organizing professional, she shares her immense knowledge on the subject with plenty of effective ways to overcome the inefficiency.</p><p>Firstly, I am confident in saying that the paperback I bought is a lifestyle magazine. Truly, because this book has the potential to make the readers happy, confident and productive. Throughout the book, Kondo has gracefully disdained a lot of information associated with cleaning and organizing while explaining a result-oriented way of organizing. I was surprised to read a few of the analogies she brought up in regards to tidying.</p><p>If I have to give you an insight into the contents of the book, I would say that the journey of reading this book starts with knowing who Kondo was as a child and her upbringing and her interest and her experiences cleaning her room and dealing with her family whom she describes as a bit untidy. She has explained the importance of giving our attention to the tasks such as tidying. Moreover, there was a clear explanation about the struggles people face to keep up with the idea of having their house tidy. Along with that, there was this ‘’how to do it the right way’’ guidance, so you achieve your dream of having a clean and organized home for yourself and become free and happy. Marie Kondo nailed it when it comes to providing solutions, techniques to practice. The book sounds like reassurance and facilitates the readers to take up the hard decisions. Her explanation on why do we need to take the hard decisions was on point. The decisions I mean, things like discarding stuff, and not involving family while doing it and how to sort your work for better results and how to change your life and do what you love to do by storing things in order and capitalizing your time on your most productive pursuit.</p><p>In simple terms, tidying is undoubtedly life-changing. So, go experience it, and I am pretty sure that you will love yourself for taking action.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=3d82bfaae90a" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This story is a refined transcript of my conversation with one of my best friends Meera Aashika. As a part of the show, I have asked Meera 5 questions and listened to her perspective and thought process. And this transcript is for all the readers on here that would love to read the conversation, more like a Q&amp;A.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Faravindspeakspodcast%2Fembed%2Fepisodes%2FTalking-Optimism-with-Meera-Aashika-e14qeh1&amp;display_name=Anchor+FM+Inc.&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fanchor.fm%2Faravindspeakspodcast%2Fepisodes%2FTalking-Optimism-with-Meera-Aashika-e14qeh1&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fd3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fpodcast_uploaded_episode400%2F12364858%2F12364858-1627422962309-463737d874ecb.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=anchor" width="400" height="102" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/ca010b1668e36f0de27cf429487c3609/href">https://medium.com/media/ca010b1668e36f0de27cf429487c3609/href</a></iframe><h3><strong>Intro</strong></h3><p>For some of you’s who don’t know who Meera is, let me narrate to you all her origin story. Meera Aashika is an Indian origin living in Dublin, Ireland. She’s from Bangalore &amp; she did her bachelor&#39;s degree there in computer science from Bishop Cottons before moving to Ireland to pursue her Master’s degree from the University of Limerick. She started her career as a promoter working in a cloakroom before getting into the software industry. Meera is a web developer, currently working with Square Spirit, a young and emerging company specialized in web design and web development and headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. Along with that, Meera is a blogger by passion. She runs an Instagram page, sharing her experiences of living in Ireland. The page has photos and videos of breathtaking scenery from Ireland. It’s called ‘’<a href="https://www.instagram.com/letzexploreirelnd/"><strong>LETZEXPLOREIRELAND</strong></a>’’. And she also does marketing for restaurants in Dublin, Ireland.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1XW0zgzeu6hQhPMeYZR_yg.png" /><figcaption>Talking Optimism with Meera Aashika Cover</figcaption></figure><h3>Q&amp;A</h3><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> After 16 months into the pandemic, could you share with us what do you really feel grateful for, and what did you learn from the last year and what is keeping you motivated every single day?</p><blockquote><strong>Meera: </strong>Well, I can’t be very specific about what I am grateful for, with just one instance. I would say that I am grateful for what I am today and during the pandemic, we all were really uncertain about our future. It’s like what is going to happen tomorrow? Are we going to be fine? So, there was always this uncertainty right. And initially, there was this hesitation like, oh are we going to be ok tomorrow.</blockquote><blockquote>If everything is going to be fine, then when is the lockdown going to get lifted, but as we start living in the lockdown, you get to start looking at the brighter side of it. What makes me get up in the morning is, doing the things I really love doing. I started making schedules for the upcoming days, like what I want to do the next day? What work am I going to do? And not just the productive things but also the things like, what am I going to eat for breakfast? and what would be my entertainment tomorrow?</blockquote><blockquote>So, I write these down every night before sleeping, and that drives me to wake up the next day with the same enthusiasm. I am looking forward to doing these activities because I really love them. As I live on my own, doing this gives me room to do the things that I aspire to do. For example, I started doing home workouts a few days ago and things like that. Once I write them down, they become my motivation.</blockquote><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> That’s awesome, thank you for sharing with us. And my second question to you would be, this is my personal question, I have come across your blog about studying in Ireland. SO, the question is, what is your advice for students thinking of studying abroad especially for the students from India planning to study in Ireland after the pandemic?</p><blockquote><strong>Meera:</strong> Ok actually, What I would say is studying abroad is a beautiful opportunity that people shouldn’t miss. And right now things are getting back to normal like all the places are opening and are operating normally. Colleges will be back, the schools are back and it’s a great opportunity that people shouldn’t miss because they will be leaving their friends the country they lived in and their comfort zone and coming to a new place broaden one’s horizons.</blockquote><blockquote>You get to see and understand the bigger picture, embrace a new culture, new traditions and that will give you new ideas for what you want to do in your life so I would say if you are someone who is looking for different things in life and if you come abroad, it’s only going to give you more room to do more things than being bound to doing only a few things.</blockquote><blockquote>And if someone’s coming to Ireland, I would suggest them to put upfront practical knowledge in their respective area of expertise or interest. Be it their career or in life, be able to apply their practical knowledge and problem-solving techniques to things ahead. Because there will always be new challenges every day, and there are always new things, new tools, and new techniques in the market. By doing these, one gets to be in a position to put in new ideas for all the new challenges and get ahead making your transition smooth making your path unique.</blockquote><p><strong>Aravind:</strong> Again, I am fascinated by the many things you do and one of them is blogging. Sometimes blogging is your career and sometimes it’s not and you keep doing it. And that’s awesome. And my question is, there are plenty of myths about blogging on the internet so, what is one myth that you think isn’t true?</p><blockquote><strong>Meera:</strong> First of all, I really enjoy writing as a person. But, I never really thought that I will be blogging someday. From my childhood, what I used to do is whether I am happy or sad or I am in a bad state, I have this habit of writing my expressions and feelings out on paper. I feel that it is more of a stress-buster activity.</blockquote><blockquote>When I was in university there was this challenge to write a blog. At that time, I was a student ambassador at the University of Limerick where we got this challenge to write one blog for the University about our experience in Ireland so far. And that got me started. I told myself the first time, Okay, I will have to do something and put it into words. It was more like an easy task for me because I am used to writing my expression. And that was the first thing that came to my mind.</blockquote><blockquote>I wrote my blog, I didn’t think much about what I have to write. It was more like, I just write my mind out, then I proofread to clear all the grammatical mistakes, making it perfect for the readers. And that’s how I started blogging. They published it. And it got a lot of attention. There were comments saying that ‘’It’s nice, you should write more’’ and that really motivated me to write more blogs and I write them whenever I feel like. I am not a blogger who plans what to write and I am more of a spontaneous writer. And for me, there’s no timeline, you may see me sitting on a bus and writing. I am that kind of a writer may be that’s within me and I enjoy doing that.</blockquote><blockquote>The one myth about bloggers or blogging is that people think that your dictionary in writing must be ‘A’ class or very good. But what I would say is that every writer or blogger has a unique style and you need to keep that unique style and that’s what is going to let people know who you are and connect with you and with all your writings so it is better not to change your style and better to maintain something that showcases what you are in your writings.</blockquote><blockquote>So, instead of having a dictionary beside and looking for a better word, start with writing what you feel like. You can’t write randomly. You need to read more to write more. And as you are reading more, your vocabulary improves so as your storytelling ability. So, when you are writing, you will be writing your own vocabulary rather than looking upon the dictionary and that will be more realistic and lovable to the readers.</blockquote><p><strong>Aravind</strong>: I saw you perform multiple roles and to be precise, you are working from a young age compared to me so could you tell me and the listeners, one of the biggest professional challenges you have faced and overcome in the past.</p><blockquote><strong>Meera</strong>: Sure. To be honest with you, when I came to Ireland I didn’t know much about the country, I wasn’t sure of what kind of roles we would be getting into, and I didn’t have any prior work experience from my home country. The very first job I got into has happened in Ireland. And it’s not an easy process as everyone knows, it took a lot of hard work from me like everyone else. I started working in different roles while I was in University. I worked in a hotel in a cloakroom in the initial days &amp; I was really happy that I was able to work forget being regretful. And that first job and the people I met there, later helped me get referred to different roles in my professional career. So, all I would say is there will always be room for finding new opportunities no matter where you work. I did work there for a couple of months before getting into the software industry.</blockquote><blockquote>So, it’s all about finding the roles you dream of and having the enthusiasm and perseverance to overcome the constant rejections. When I was applying for a better job, I did give plenty of interviews in IT companies and I did get rejections. And that didn’t stop me and say that this is the end; it only gave me more courage to seek more opportunities to find better roles that suit me and makes me enjoy the work I do and I am in that place today. Losing out on opportunities gave me a chance for a better opportunity that I cherish wholeheartedly. I can confidently say that every single rejection was a learning lesson.</blockquote><blockquote>So, for the people who are reading, I would say that rejections are common. Sometimes, despite performing well and getting great feedback one could still get rejected for some reason, you got to learn to be okay with rejections. You know we all aim for the moon right and we may not always end up on the moon, so it is the same in my case too. I initially wanted a role in software engineering like core programming and stuff but I ended up as a web developer now and I am happy with the way things has gone off so far.</blockquote><blockquote>There are still a lot of challenges I face like I am currently looking for a different role, and I’m currently working on it. And, there will always be new challenges, and we just have to be grinding and keep going and also the second thing is that I believe that you don’t have to seek help from everyone every time. I would rather say someone to try and attend the job interviews on their own because it helps a lot. The more you attend the interviews, the more you know about what skills you are lacking, so do that and get better yourself, it is easier and more beneficial.</blockquote><p><strong>Aravind</strong>: Thank you Meera and my final question to you is about the last year’s lockdown. We know it was a tough year so, how much did you age up in 2020, and what were your biggest learnings from the pandemic?</p><blockquote><strong>Meera: </strong>I definitely feel like I have evolved during the pandemic and the reason is simple. During the year 2020, I was able to do plenty of things that I have never done before. The pandemic has given me the room to pursue these activities, such as hiking and trekking. I have been in Dublin for 4 years and I hardly go for hikes, but I was certainly doing a lot of them. There’s a new hike like every weekend and I enjoy doing it.</blockquote><blockquote>I have always wanted to be a part of a book club. And during this pandemic, I have come across a book club and I took part in it. It was an online book club that is a safe space during the pandemic to interact with people right? I am usually a curious person, I like to keep a lot of things on my plate like I enjoy doing multiple things. I have a taste right, so when it comes to reading I’d usually go read one article or a journal either crime or mystery but this book club again allowed me to read different books. Books about Irish culture and depression and many more.</blockquote><blockquote>And we used to have book club meetings where you can actively talk about what you have read and express your opinion, and I would have never done that if not if I have never had the time for so I would say those were the positives and there are a lot more. I have an Instagram page for blogging and it’s called ‘’LETZEXPLOREIRELAND’’ but I wasn’t really active on it earlier on, but again the pandemic made me get a bit active with it. I started taking multiple pictures from the hikes, visiting new places and there are so many hidden gems in Dublin people aren’t aware of so I am getting to explore them and share them on the page the beautiful landscapes across the country of Ireland.</blockquote><blockquote>I have been living with the thought that this could all be gone tomorrow so I am living in the moment feeling fulfilled with my pursuit. And that’s what I learned in the pandemic. On the contrary to how it may sound like, I’m sure that most people would have gone through a lot of struggles like job loss and all and I know it was a hard time but I am just saying that there are so many good things going on as well, things you would have never thought that you will witness. So, I am cherishing all the good that has happened during the pandemic.</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9e4fcc010cc9" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded>
